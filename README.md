# Problem statement

The internet is full of software and source code. Some of that software is
actively developed, some is mature but receives security updates and other
infrequent changes and a lot of it is abandonware or one-off demo.

As software developers you have both a responsibility and a duty to your fellow
developers to clearly state if something is supported or not. It's always
annoying to find that one of your dependencies is no longer maintained.

# Project Status

Wouldn't it be great if it was easy to clearly and unambiguously state that a
project is no longer supported or that conversely it is actively supported?
Enter **project status** shields. We supply you with an easy-to-use shield
that documents how the author or principal maintainer sees a given repository.

## Shaping

![This project is shaping and unstable](https://img.shields.io/badge/project--status-shaping-00ffff.svg)

The project is actively evolving and may be the next big thing but at this
moment only early adopters are welcome. Maintainers are working on new features
but don't plan to make new releases that can be used as a stable base just yet.

## Active in {Year}

![This project is active and stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/project--status-active_in_2018-brightgreen.svg)

The project is actively developed and should offers a solid base for other
software. It is past its early development stages and can be used by third
parties. Maintainers are working periodic new releases.

The `{year}` indicates when the project last updated its status.

## Maintained in {Year}

![This project is supported but not developed](https://img.shields.io/badge/project--status-maintained_in_2018-yellowgreen.svg)

The project is not actively developed but is maintained and may make occasional
releases with new features, bug fixes and security fixes. New projects may
want to re-consider using it as a dependency but immediate migration is not neccessary.

The `{year}` indicates when the project last updated its status.

## On life support in {Year}

![This project is on life support](https://img.shields.io/badge/project--status-on_life_support_in_2018-red.svg)

The project is not actively developed and the maintainers may only apply
security fixes, if any. If you use it as a dependency you should strongly 
consider migrating to another project.

The `{year}` indicates when the project last updated its status.

## Abandoned

![This project is abandoned](https://img.shields.io/badge/project--status-abandoned-lightgrey.svg)

The project may have been great once or it may have been just a demo.
In either case it is not actively maintained anymore. If you have it
as a dependency then immediately migrate to another project.
